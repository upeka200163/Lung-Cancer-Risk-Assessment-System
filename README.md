## 🧮 Risk Calculation Logic

### Algorithm Overview

The system uses a **weighted scoring algorithm** based on clinical research and established risk factors for lung cancer. Each symptom and factor is assigned a point value based on its correlation with lung cancer risk.

### Scoring System (Total: 100 points)

#### 1. **Age Factor** (0-20 points)
Age is a significant risk factor for lung cancer:
```
Age > 60:  20 points
Age > 50:  15 points
Age > 40:  10 points
Age > 30:   5 points
Age ≤ 30:   0 points
```

**Rationale:** Lung cancer incidence increases significantly after age 50, with peak occurrence in the 65-75 age range.

---

#### 2. **Critical Symptoms** (High Weight: 67 points total)

These are primary indicators strongly associated with lung cancer:

| Symptom | Points | Clinical Significance |
|---------|--------|----------------------|
| **Smoking** | 25 | Strongest risk factor; 85-90% of lung cancers are smoking-related |
| **Persistent Coughing** | 15 | Common early symptom, especially if lasting >3 weeks |
| **Chest Pain** | 15 | May indicate tumor growth or pleural involvement |
| **Shortness of Breath** | 12 | Suggests airway obstruction or pleural effusion |

**Total Critical Symptoms:** 67 points

---

#### 3. **Secondary Symptoms** (Medium Weight: 22 points total)

These symptoms support the diagnosis but are less specific:

| Symptom | Points | Clinical Significance |
|---------|--------|----------------------|
| **Swallowing Difficulty** | 8 | May indicate esophageal compression by tumor |
| **Yellow Fingers** | 7 | Nicotine staining; indirect smoking indicator |
| **Chronic Disease** | 7 | Pre-existing conditions increase susceptibility |
| **Fatigue** | 5 | Common in advanced stages |

**Total Secondary Symptoms:** 27 points (capped at 22 in implementation)

---

#### 4. **Lifestyle & Environmental Factors** (Low Weight: 12 points total)

Contributing factors that increase overall risk:

| Factor | Points | Clinical Significance |
|--------|--------|----------------------|
| **Alcohol Consumption** | 5 | Synergistic effect with smoking |
| **Anxiety** | 3 | May delay seeking medical care |
| **Peer Pressure** | 2 | Social smoking influence |
| **Allergy** | 2 | Chronic inflammation factor |

**Total Lifestyle Factors:** 12 points

---

### Risk Level Classification

The total score is converted to a **percentage** and classified into three risk categories:

```javascript
Total Score → Percentage = (Score / 100) × 100

Risk Levels:
- Low Risk:      0% - 34%   (Green)
- Moderate Risk: 35% - 59%  (Yellow)
- High Risk:     60% - 100% (Red)
```

#### Risk Level Definitions:

| Level | Range | Meaning | Recommended Action |
|-------|-------|---------|-------------------|
| **Low Risk** | 0-34% | Minimal concerning symptoms | Maintain healthy lifestyle, routine check-ups |
| **Moderate Risk** | 35-59% | Some risk factors present | Consult primary care physician, monitor symptoms |
| **High Risk** | 60-100% | Multiple significant risk factors | **Immediate medical evaluation**, consider LDCT scan |

## 📊 Example Calculations

### Example 1: High Risk Patient
```
Patient Profile:
- Age: 65 (20 points)
- Smoking: Yes (25 points)
- Coughing: Yes (15 points)
- Chest Pain: Yes (15 points)
- Shortness of Breath: Yes (12 points)
- Chronic Disease: Yes (7 points)

Total Score: 94 points
Risk Percentage: 94%
Classification: HIGH RISK ⚠️
```

### Example 2: Low Risk Patient
```
Patient Profile:
- Age: 28 (0 points)
- Smoking: No (0 points)
- Coughing: No (0 points)
- Chest Pain: No (0 points)
- Anxiety: Yes (3 points)
- Allergy: Yes (2 points)

Total Score: 5 points
Risk Percentage: 5%
Classification: LOW RISK ✅
```

### Example 3: Moderate Risk Patient
```
Patient Profile:
- Age: 52 (15 points)
- Smoking: Yes (25 points)
- Alcohol: Yes (5 points)
- Fatigue: Yes (5 points)

Total Score: 50 points
Risk Percentage: 50%
Classification: MODERATE RISK ⚡
```

## 🤖 AI Integration (Gemini API)

After calculating the numerical risk score, the system calls **Google Gemini 1.5 Flash** to generate:

1. **Personalized Health Advice** based on the patient's specific symptoms
2. **Contextual Recommendations** (lifestyle changes, when to see a doctor)
3. **Educational Information** about the risk factors present

### API Flow:
```
User Submits Form

## 🔬 Clinical Basis

This risk assessment is based on established medical research:

### Key Risk Factors (Source: WHO, American Cancer Society)

1. **Smoking:** 
   - Accounts for 85-90% of lung cancer cases
   - Risk increases with duration and intensity

2. **Age:**
   - Median age of diagnosis: 70 years
   - Rare before age 40

3. **Symptoms:**
   - Persistent cough (>3 weeks)
   - Hemoptysis (coughing blood)
   - Chest pain
   - Dyspnea (shortness of breath)
   - Weight loss and fatigue

4. **Environmental Factors:**
   - Secondhand smoke exposure
   - Occupational exposures (asbestos, radon)
   - Air pollution

---

## 🚨 Limitations

1. **Not a Diagnostic Tool:** This system provides risk estimation only, not medical diagnosis.
2. **Simplified Model:** Real clinical assessment involves imaging (CT scans), biopsies, and comprehensive medical history.
3. **Self-Reported Data:** Accuracy depends on honest and accurate user input.
4. **No Medical History:** Does not account for family history, genetic factors, or previous medical conditions beyond what's asked.

---

## 🛡️ Privacy & Security

- **No Data Storage:** All calculations happen in the browser; no data is sent to our servers.
- **API Calls:** Only anonymized symptom data is sent to Gemini API for advice generation.
- **No Personal Identifiable Information (PII):** The app does not collect names, addresses, or contact information.
